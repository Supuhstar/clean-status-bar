Clean Status Bar
=================================

Tired of Photoshopping out notifications/low battery to make a nice, clean status bar for the Play Store? Run this app first - it draws over your status bar, showing only a full battery and clock.

It runs as a service, so you can swap to other apps to take screenshots.
